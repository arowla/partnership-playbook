# CDS: Partnership Playbook
This guide will help you, as an agency, understand what itâ€™s like to work with CDS. The playbook is broken down into eight principles. You'll learn what to expect and get a sense of the challenges you may face when working with a modern digital service team, which will likely be a significantly different experience than working with a contractor.

This playbook is a complement to the [U.S. Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov).

This playbook is a set of markdown files and is published to the web using Github Pages.
